###Basic Definitions

__Mutable__: liable to change.
**Immutable**: unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

Therefore, immutable data is data that cannot be modified.

Note that this is NOT the same thing as have a constant variable (like `const` in es6). This concepts are often conflated, but variable assignment is very different than instantiating data.
